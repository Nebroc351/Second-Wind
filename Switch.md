# Second Wind: Nintendo Switch Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

- A Nintendo Switch (moddable or modchipped)
- A physical or digital copy of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* v1.6.0 with its DLCs
- A 64-bit PC running Windows (recommended) or Linux
- A microSD card with at least 20 GB of free space

---

## Modding Your Console

To use mods or play via emulator, your console **must be modded**. Modding unlocks access to custom themes, homebrew, and mod support without restricting normal functionality.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not all Switch models are soft-moddable, but all can be modded with a modchip.

Refer to [this guide](https://switch.hacks.guide/) to determine how to mod your specific Switch model.

If your Switch is already modded, skip ahead to the next section.

## Dumping the Game

To install Second Wind (even on-console), you must dump your copy of *Breath of the Wild* to your PC. The full dump is approximately 15 GB, so ensure both your SD card and PC have at least 20 GB of free space.

Check that you are running **version 1.6.0** with **DLC version 3.0**. Nintendo's more recent updates (1.8.0+) are incompatible with most mods.

### Dumping Options
There are two methods available, both covered on [this guide](https://dardel.codeberg.page/nxdumpguide/):

- **Dumping RomFS (Modders)** ‚Äî Recommended for console users
- **Dumping to PC (Emulator Users)** ‚Äî Use this if playing on an emulator, then extract the RomFS

After dumping the game and DLCs in RomFS format, store them in a well-organized location such as:
- `C:/Games/Switch/Breath of the Wild/Game+Update/romfs`
- `C:/Games/Switch/Breath of the Wild/DLC/romfs`

You may delete the files from your SD card once transferred.
