# Second-Wind

Second Wind is a large-scale expansion for Breath of the Wild that aims to add new content to the game in a similar way to official DLCs. We've also decided to take things a step further by providing various overhauls, bug fixes, tweaks and new gameplay elements for players to explore.

We hope that many come to see Second Wind as part of the definitive experience while playing Breath of the Wild.
